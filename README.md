#Intelligent Fruit Quality Grading System
The Intelligent Fruit Quality Grading System is a demo application designed to automate the assessment of fruit quality. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it identifies and grades fruits based on their appearance, which significantly impacts market value and consumer choice.

#Features:
Fruit Identification (Phase 1): The system identifies various fruits, including apples, bananas, and oranges, using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm.
Quality Detection (Phase 2): After identifying the fruit, the system assesses its quality. For instance, it can determine ripeness, freshness, and defects.
#Technologies Used:
Mobile App Development: The app is built using Flutter, a powerful framework for creating cross-platform mobile applications.
Backend API: The backend, responsible for processing requests and providing results, is developed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
#Repository:
For the Flask backend code, please visit the fruitector-api repository.
